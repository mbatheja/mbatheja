## Hi there, I am Mahima 👋

I build data-driven healthcare products that make clinical and health data more accessible to patients, providers, and healthcare stakeholders. Most of my work sits at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and product thinking, with a strong focus on real-world impact.

I’m currently deepening my skills in data engineering using PySpark and Databricks, and I enjoy working across the stack—from data pipelines to predictive models and lightweight frontend prototypes.

My toolkit includes: Python, SQL, PySpark, Databricks, Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, ArcGIS Pro, and ML/NLP workflows.

Let’s collaborate on: Machine Learning, NLP, healthcare analytics, data platforms, or data-backed product prototypes.

🧞 Fun fact: My favorite LLM so far is Claude.
